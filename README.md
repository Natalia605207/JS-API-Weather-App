The purpose of this project was to train my skills in **Figma** and then, to use the final design for creating a nice website.

Moreover, I also practiced JavaScript to make **a responsive fixed top navbar** with redirection to corresponding website sections as well as GSAP and AOS (Animated On Scroll Library) **to animate images and words**.

**Parallax Scrolling effects**, **the :hover selector** on buttons and **the rotate() method** on some elements are also contribute to the website appearance.
